# Background

The vulnerability scanning requirements are part of the FedRAMP
Continuous Monitoring Strategy Guide and the appropriate FedRAMP Low,
Moderate, or High security control baselines, speciﬁcally in control
RA-5.

The ConMon scanning requirements move FedRAMP ConMon activities toward
efﬁciencies, advance the quality of ConMon information provided to
FedRAMP, and better position FedRAMP to perform robust analysis in the
near future. These changes also better enable FedRAMP to scale up as
the volume of FedRAMP Authorized systems continues to increase.

Further, FedRAMP has an obligation to determine and enforce CSP
compliance with such security requirements.
