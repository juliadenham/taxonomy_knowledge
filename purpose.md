# Purpose

Continuous monitoring (ConMon) ensures CSPs continuously maintain the
security of their FedRAMP Authorized systems by providing the Joint
Authorization Board (JAB) and authorizing ofﬁcials (AOs) monthly
insight into the security posture of the system. CSP scanning
policies, procedures, and tools (including vulnerability scanners) are
key components to ConMon activities. In an effort to increase the
efﬁciency and effectiveness of ConMon activities, the FedRAMP Program
Management Ofﬁce (PMO) provides guidance for scanning requirements.
This document summarizes those requirements.
